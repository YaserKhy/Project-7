### Goal 
Students Project App is a responsive Flutter application that helps admins manage and organize student projects by leveraging the Tuwaiq Project System API. The app allows users to interact with the API to fetch, display, and manipulate project data through a user-friendly interface.


### Key Features 
To ensure a seamless user experience, we’ve implemented key features such as:

- Add Projects: Admins can add student projects to the system.
- Edit Projects: Admins can update details for existing projects.
- Delete Projects: Admins can delete projects from the system.
- View Projects: Projects are displayed based on different categories
- Search: Users can search in diffrent projects easily to find specific data.


#### User Flow 🎯

1. **Supervisor**  
   The supervisor has full access to the app, with the ability to add, delete, modify projects, and more.

2. **Students**  
   If a student has a project, they can edit it and add team members.

3. **Guest**  
   Guests can search for and rate projects but have no editing privileges.
